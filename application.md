# Introduction

High-Throughput sequencing (HTS) is poised to revolutionize how biodiversity is
studied. The parellel sequencing of all species found in a community replaces
the time-consuming steps of isolating and recognizing each species found in an
environmental sample, and even allows the characterization of communities whose
members could not be identified based on morphology. The challenge now rests on
developing informatic tools that can take advantage of publicly available data
to match these DNA sequences to the organisms they are coming from.

Estimates for the number of species found in the oceans vary by orders of
magnitude. This uncertainty stems from the difficulty of sampling the diversity
of habitats hidden under the ocean's surface, and our relative poor taxonomic
knowledge for most groups. The use of molecular data to study marine
biodiversity has improved our understanding of how species are distributed in
space, how they interact, how they are related to each others, and how to
distinguish them. Since the early 2000's, DNA barcoding has been widely adopted
by the community to facilitate future identification, and uncover species
complexes. Almost 5 milions DNA barcodes are publicly available representing
diverse taxonomic groups, from all latitudes, covering both marine and
terrestrial habitats. This dataset is the most comprehensive for which the same
gene has been sequenced and is associated with curated taxonomic information. To
take advantage of this data, metabarcoding targeting COI is emerging as the
approach of choice to characterize marine communities based on DNA. However,
marine biodiversity is still poorly characterized, and many taxa have not yet
been sequenced for COI. The challenge adressed by this research is to find the
most likely taxon for a sequence given the species that have been sequenced for
COI.

<!-- if including community phylogenetic give some background on it -->

<!-- need to talk on how much better it is to assemble local database of COI -->
<!-- sequences to increase chances of matching -->


Current software used to assign taxon names to DNA sequences generated with HTS
are ill-suited for animal communities. These software were originally designed
to analyze sequences originating from microbial communities. Studies using
"amplicon sequencing" on bacteria typically target the genetic marker 16S. It is
known to provide good resolution at low taxonomic scale and is easy to amplify
across a large diversity of species. Several databases of 16S sequences for
bacteria have been assembled against which researchers can match their
sequences. Because 16S in a non protein-coding gene, it evolves differently from
COI, and the algorithms used to match the 16S sequences to the reference
database do not take advantage of the protein-coding nature of COI. Another
approach with bacterial communities, metagenomics, seeks to match genomic DNA
from environmental samples to sequenced genomes. This approach is still not
applicable across diverse groups of animals given that genomes are larger than
in bacteria, and most taxa do not have genomes available.

I propose to develop new informatic tools and open-source software to assign
taxon names to protein-coding DNA sequences generated in metabarcoding
studies. I will test the performance and accuracy of these tools on simulated
datasets, and on metabarcoding datasets generated from marine communities. This
research is interdisciplinary and integrates biodiversity informatics,
evolutionary biology, ecology, and statistics.

Over the course of this project, I will work on three goals:

- **Goal 1:** develop a web-based tool to manage the heterogeneous but linked
  data generated in biodiversity surveys.
- **Goal 2:** improve the assignment of taxonomic information to DNA sequences
  generated during metabarcoding surveys.
- **Goal 3:** combine sequence data and taxonomic information to generate
  community phylogenies based on the sequences obtained from metabarcoding.


![Comparison of workflows for barcoding and metabarcoding. With barcoding (A), tissues from specimens are used to isolate their DNA (gray strand). The barcoding gene (colored dots) is amplified by PCR, and an unique sequence for each specimen is obtained using Sanger sequencing. The sequences obtained can be used to build a reference library, where sequences are associated with a voucher specimen. With metabarcoding (B), DNA from an environmental sample (e.g., sea water containing planktonic larvae) is isolated. This solution contains DNA from multiple species, and the barcoding gene is amplified for the species. An High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) platform (e.g., Illumina) is used to sequence all the amplified fragments of DNA (the amplicons). These sequences are analysed bioinformatically: the sequences are matched against a reference database to identify the species contained in the environmental sample.](figures/drawing.pdf)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Box 1**

**Barcoding and COI** A portion of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI, a
mitochondrial gene) has emerged as a universal genetic marker to document
genetic diversity in animals. For most taxonomic group, COI has low
intra-specific but high inter-specific variation allowing species delineation
and identification.  A public database (BOLD, the Barcode Of Life Datasytem) has
been developed to store these DNA sequences alongside with voucher information
(in which natural history museum is the specimen from which the DNA comes from
held?), photography of specimens, and quality control on the sequence
data. Currently, this publicly available database holds almost 5 million
sequences from specimens collected worldwide, and from a large diversity of
taxonomic groups.

One of the strengths of DNA barcoding is that it allows the identification of
animals from parts and from all stages of the life cycles. It becomes possible
to identify species found in fish guts to infer their diet, or to associate
larval forms to the adults (which butterfly is this caterpillar going to
metamorphose into? or what is the adult stage of this larva found in the
plankton?)

Among closely related species, COI sequences mostly vary at the third codon
position. Because of the redundance of the genetic code, mutations on the third
codon affect less often the protein sequence than mutations at the other two
codons. Among more distantly related taxa, this excess of mutations on the third
codon may lead to convergent mutations. This leads algorithms based on sequence
similarity to assign sequences to the wrong taxa if no exact match is found.
However, these distantly related taxa will also include mutations on the other
codons that will lead to differences in their protein sequences. Because the
protein sequence will evolve slower than the nucleotide sequence, it will be
more accurate to infer the higher taxonomy from the sequence.

# Research questions

Global and local threats (e.g., ocean acidification, increased temperatures,
pollution, overfishing) require better characterization and monitoring of marine
communities, so we can evaluate and understand their impact on biodiversity and
on how communities are assembled. Metabarcoding makes it possible to estimate
the number of species occurring in the plankton, in the gut of fish (to infer
their diet), or in marine sediments. Identifying species in such communities
based on morphology is time consuming, and often imperfect, as identifications
must be done on character-poor organisms (e.g., larvae in the plankton) or on
fragments (e.g., a shrimp leg in a fish gut).

Metabarcoding is still a new technology whose limitations need to be better
defined, but its potential to help us understand not only how many species are
found in a given community, but also identity the species will imporove our
understanding on how these communities are assembled, and in turn gain insights
into basic information on the natural history of taxa for which no data
currently exist. <!-- give examples: are closely related taxa reproduce at the -->
<!-- same time of the year; what is the effect of the lunar cycle/seasons on the
reproduction; how do predators target their preys; how does the phylogenetic -->
<!-- composition of a community changes along environmental gradients --->

### 1. Comparison of metabarcoding from benthic and planktonic communities in contrasting environments

Compare overlap in species composition between individuals being barcoded,
species found in the plankton, and metabarcode of scrapings. Compare results
between Line Islands and Bocas del Toro, Panama. Take advantage of the Moorea
biocode database.

### 2. Temporal dynamics of community relatedness in the plankton

Compare how the taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of the planktonic
communities changes through the year.


# Approach and methods

To answer these questions, I will need to generate phylogenies representative of
the communities. These phylogenies will be generated based on the output of the
softwares developed in Goals 1 & 2. The source code will be open source, and
development will be open to collaboration as it will be hosted on GitHub
(https://github.com).


### Goal 1 -- a light-weight extensible Laboratory Information Management System for barcoding projects

Data collected when assembling a barcoding library are heterogenous in
nature. Need to keep track of specimen information, taxonomic information
associated with the specimen, molecular laboratory work, sequence data, live
photography. BOLD is an online platform, useful to upload data before
publication and to submit data to genbank but researchers need something more
lightweight that they can use to manage, view, and prepare their data before
publishing it/uploading it to BOLD.

There is currently no open-source LIMS designed for barcoding.

Developed as an R package (the API), and with a web-application in Shiny from
the front-end. Because most researchers use some R, they will be able to
contribute, extend it, and modify it for their own needs. The same API will be
used to generate the data on the front-end, and for researchers to work with the
data they can use for their research. It is also easy to deploy. Currently,
already available as a Docker image. Data storred in a SQLite database and
simple file system. Easy to backup and manage. Proof of concept of the front-end
avaialble at http://104.131.113.146/flpk-shiny/ code for the source available at
https://github.com/fmichonneau/labmanager and
https://github.com/fmichonneau/flpk-shiny

Data stored according to Darwin Core fields. Easy to export in format required
by BOLD.

### Goal 2 -- improving DNA sequence classification for COI metabarcodes

I propose to modify the current workflow used in DNA sequence classification to
include a step where the DNA sequences get translated into their protein
sequence. By being less variable than DNA sequences, protein sequences will
increase the probability of finding a match in public databases, and narrow down
the taxonomic scope to which the DNA sequence can be matched. This approach will
complement existing software that provide adequate results when an exact or
close match exist in the reference database. However, because many marine taxa
are incompletely sampled, the probability for an exact match is generally low.

On a dataset of COI sequences for planktonic larvae of marine invertebrates
collected in Florida (a relatively well studied location for its marine fauna),
less than 25% have close or exact matches in the BOLD database. This number is
expected to be even lower when sequences from environmental sample will be
analyzed. When using the software SAP, a popular sequence classifier routinely
used in metabarcoding studies, only 33% of these sequences could be assigned at
the phylum level, and 18% at the species level (using GenBank). These low levels
of assignment stem from the lack of significant homolog matches when comparing
input DNA sequences and sequences available in public databases. In other words,
sequences available in reference databases are too divergent from the sample
sequences (closely related taxa have not been sequenced).

The software SAP is commonly used in metabarcoding studies because it uses two
complimentary approaches when attempting to find a match in the reference
database (while most other software use only one), and it provides a confidence
score for this assignment. First, the sequence to be matched is used to look for
homolog sequences based on sequence similarity (a BLAST search). The reference
sequences that match best and the sample sequence are aligned. This alignment
and bootstrap replicates of it are used to estimate phylogenetic trees. From
this set of trees, the frequency with which the sequence to assign clusters with
the same taxa gives a confidence value for this assignment. By using the higher
taxonomy of the reference sequences similar confidence values are given at the
genus, family, order, class and phylum level.

I will develop a new software that will modify the approach taken by
SAP. Instead of looking for homolog sequences based only on the nucleotide
sequences, I will also include homologs based on their respective protein
sequences. This approach will increase the likelihood of finding matches in the
reference database, and will allow the assignment to a higher-level taxon when
no exact match is found. I will develop this software in Python. This software
will be relatively easy to implement as it is mostly a wrapper around other
pre-existing well-tested software.

Another area of improvement for software aimed at analyzing metabarcoding data
is during the assessment of the quality of the sequences. It is common to
translate DNA sequences into their protein sequence, and remove sequences that
include stop codons. Those could arise from sequencing error, or from the
amplification of pseudo-genes. This quality control step is done using the
standard genetic code. However, across the diversity of animal phyla that can be
found in metabarcoding studies, especially in the marine realm, alternative
genetic codes are encountered (e.g., echinoderms, cnidarians,
platyhelminthes). These codes translate a codon interpreted as a stop codon in
the standard code as a valid amino-acid (UGA). Thus, DNA sequences encoding for
functional COI proteins get discarded, removing systematically some taxa from
the analyses. My software will include a more careful quality control step that
will account for the presence of these alternative genetic codes.
